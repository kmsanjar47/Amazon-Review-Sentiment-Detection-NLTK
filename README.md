Design and implement a machine learning model to classify Amazon product reviews as positive or negative using two popular algorithms, Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression. The dataset consists of two columns: 'reviewText' containing the text of the review and 'Positive' where a value of 1 indicates a positive review and 0 indicates a negative review.
